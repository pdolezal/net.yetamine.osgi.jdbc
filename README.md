# net.yetamine.osgi.jdbc #

This repository provides an OSGi that adapts JDBC code (both drivers and clients) on-the-fly to run within an OSGi container without any code modification.


## Usage ##

Install the bundle with its dependencies in your favourite OSGi container ([Karaf](http://karaf.apache.org/) recommended). If you deploy JDBC drivers in the OSGi container, the drivers must be OSGi-fied, but the code needs no changes. Deploying drivers on the boot classpath an option as well, but this way gives up all benefits of the modular environment.


## Limitations

The used technique employs OSGi weaving hooks to instrument loaded classes in runtime. This approach works well with usual static code, but it can't intercept dynamic invocations like calling `DriverManager` with reflection (for which hardly any reason exists though). Other limitations are related to the weaving hooks themselves: if the OSGi container does not call the hook for whatever reason (e.g., the extender is not activated yet or the driver bundle is hidden by some other means), the extender gets no chance to instrument some classes.

Since the implementation is based on the [ASM](http://asm.ow2.org/), it suffers from bugs of this (otherwise great) tool. One of the known problems is [a problem with JSR/RET](http://mail-archive.ow2.org/asm/2008-11/msg00007.html), which may happen with some old code or code generated by compilers that still use these deprecated instructions. This tool simply skips such classes, with a warning, but this non-solution may lead to adaptation failure.

The current implementation does not handle stopping driver bundles and provides no option to exclude some bundles from weavingâ€¦ yet.
